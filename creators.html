                    <h1>Casidy Cunningham</h1>

                    <p>Casidy Cunningham (she/her) is a rising junior and Human Rights major at Columbia University.</p>

                    <p>As a creative outlet, Cas uses her free time to crochet! So far, she’s made sweaters, a wrap top, a cardigan, a bucket hat, shorts, and bralettes—including a bralette she completely designed herself. She first learned in 6th grade and picked it back up in December after being inspired by another Black crochet artist, @Eurythmik on IG and Twitter. </p>

                    <p>As a low-income student, Cas has been accepting custom orders as a small source of income. However, she has also been able to donate 100% of proceeds from past customs to Minnesota Freedom Fund, Black Visions Collective, The Massachusetts Bail Fund, National Bail Out, among others.</p>

                    <p>Cas is pictured here wearing her incredible pieces! Check out more of her work at these links:</p>
