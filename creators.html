                    <h1>Casidy Cunningham</h1>

                    <p>Casidy Cunningham (she/her) is a rising junior and Human Rights major at Columbia University.</p>

                    <p>As a creative outlet, Cas uses her free time to crochet! So far, she’s made sweaters, a wrap top, a cardigan, a bucket hat, shorts, and bralettes—including a bralette she completely designed herself. She first learned in 6th grade and picked it back up in December after being inspired by another Black crochet artist, @Eurythmik on IG and Twitter. </p>

                    <p>As a low-income student, Cas has been accepting custom orders as a small source of income. However, she has also been able to donate 100% of proceeds from past customs to Minnesota Freedom Fund, Black Visions Collective, The Massachusetts Bail Fund, National Bail Out, among others.</p>

                    <p>Cas is pictured here wearing her incredible pieces! Check out more of her work at these links:</p>

                    <h1>Julia Jordahl-Henry</h1>

                    <p>Julia is a rising Sophomore and Computer Science Major with intended Business concentration at Columbia University. She is an athlete on the Women’s Track team and a member of Columbia’s Students of Color Advisory Board. </p>

                    <p>Julia has been organizing within her hometown for over a year now starting with the cofounding of Young Ethnic Scholars as a senior in high school. During quarantine, she started a BlackAtWellesley account for her hometown, so her peers could anonymously share their experiences with racism. Recently, she spoke at a protest in Wellesley, Massachusetts about the power of her White privilege as a “White-passing” biracial person of color.   </p>

                    <p>Julia was born with “White-passing” skin and features and a stereotypically biracial presenting twin sister. As a result, Julia grew up hyper-aware of just how much she benefitted from her Whiteness over her sister. She wrote her speech about how much of an impact her White privilege had on her life. She hopes that White allies learn to recognize their White privilege over their peers and actively fight to demolish it.</p>

                    <h1>Rachel Marsh</h1>

                    <p>Rachel Marsh, 19, is a part of the class of 2023 at Columbia University. She is majoring in psychology with the intent to attend Law School afterwards. She is also a student-athlete on the Columbia track and field team. Rachel is extremely passionate about photography. She specializes in portraiture work but hopes to expand into fashion photography and more editorial style work soon. </p>

                    <p>After starting a small photography business two years ago, she decided that she wanted to do a lot more than just take photos and began to think about different ways she could infuse that skill into something that would make a greater impact on her community. So, this summer she launched Brazen, a project she had in the works for a very long time. The blog focuses on connecting artists of all mediums to promote individuality and inclusivity.  </p>

                    <p>On the website she personally speaks to issues relevant to her life, her social climate, and the ways in which her personal experiences help shape who she is becoming.
                        Apart from her own contribution, the blog is also committed to highlighting other local talent/artists — specifically from marginalized groups and highlighting the value in remaining connected to creative outlets.

                    <h1>Bianca Alonzo</h1>

                    <p>Bianca is a recent graduate from Columbia University, with a double major in Political Science and History. Before graduation, she spent her time at Columbia dedicated to a mission of social justice, with a particular focus on criminal justice. Motivated by her family’s experience with the criminal justice system, she gained experience in criminal justice reform through professional opportunities. During her undergraduate studies, she interned at Essie Justice Group (Oakland, California) and Vera Institute of Justice (New York, New York) to develop a deeper understanding of the latest research and policies on various human rights violations regarding the treatment of women in jails and prisons within the United States. Bianca continued her criminal justice work through various fellowships offered by Columbia University, including the Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship in Criminal Justice and Eric Holder Initiative. </p>

                    <p>Outside of her criminal justice work, Bianca was a member of the Columbia Track and Field and Cross Country team. She helped her cross-country team win two Ivy League titles and qualify for the NCAA XC championships. Individually, she has gained All Ivy-League honors and All-Academic honors. Additionally, she spent her free time mentoring middle school distance runners through a program called Division One Student Athletes LLC.</p>

                    <p>Currently, Bianca is preparing to apply to Law School in the future to continue her criminal justice work and hopes to become an agent in effectively dismantling oppressive institutions in the United States.</p>
