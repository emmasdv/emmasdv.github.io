                    <h1>Committing to Anti-Racism</h1>

                    <p>Committing to anti-racism requires the distinction between being simply non-racist and being actively anti-racist. A non-racist person will disagree with a racist statement but stay silent and remain neutral in situations of injustice. An anti-racist activist will stand up to racist statements or actions, start conversations and challenge racist beliefs. The only way to make significant strides away from racism is to become actively anti-racist and speak up for what is right. This site intends to serve as a centralized hub of resources to help one work towards anti-racism.</p>

                    <h1>Black Lives Matter</h1>

                    <p>The Black Lives Matter movement was formed to advocate for Black lives and to raise awareness of the racism that is still very prevalent in today’s society. To deny the fact that Black people face overt and covert racism in their everyday lives is to ignorantly refuse to believe what is truly happening in the world around us.</p>

                    <h1>Why You Should Care (as a Non-Black Person)</h1>

                    <p>For many White people/some non-Black POC, George Floyd’s tragic death was an eye-opening moment of realization that racism is still very much alive in America, as far as we like to think we have come from our country’s history of racism. However, this is a reality that the Black community has been dealing with their entire lives. For some people, racism is something that they have had the privilege to learn about recently on the internet rather than their whole lives through experience. White people and certain non-Black POC have the ability to choose whether or not they want to care about this issue – but Black people are not privileged enough to have that choice. They will face this reality no matter what. It's vital that we all take the time to educate ourselves about systemic racism in America so that we can better understand the realities of injustice present around us today, especially if we haven't already been made aware of them through our own experiences.</p>

                    <h1>Addressing Your White Privilege</h1>

                    <p>As a white person living in America, it can be uncomfortable to confront your privilege. That being said, your discomfort is no excuse to shy away from addressing the deep-seated racial injustices present now, and throughout all of American history. White privilege is in no way suggesting that white people do not face adversities. Instead, it is attempting to confront the way that our white skin acts as a shield of armor, protecting us from the systemic racism faced by the Black and Brown people in America every day. Addressing white privilege is not an attack on white people, it is simply an attempt to dismantle and restructure the racist systems that have been controlling the way America functions both legally and socially. Confront your privilege, immerse yourself in books, articles, podcasts, have difficult conversations with family & friends, and do your part to create a truly equitable society for all.   </p>

                    <h1>A Message for Non-Black POC</h1>

                    <p> I write this from my perspective - as someone who is a non-Black POC. As non-Black POC, we aren't strangers to the racism that still exists in America today. I'm sure we have all had to deal with our fair share of comments about our appearances and cultures as minorities. However, there is often anti-Blackness rooted even in other minority cultures and we must be aware of this. For example, we must be aware of colorism against afro-Latinx people in the Hispanic community. Similarly, we must be wary of the "model minority myth" that society places upon Asian and Indian cultures - where Indian and Asian people are often stereotyped as the "smarter" or "more successful" minorities. I will link articles below to explain those two phenomemons in greater depth, but as fellow POC in America we must be aware of the anti-Blackness in our own communities. Being POC doesn't make us exempt from this - it's still necessary to educate yourself & have those difficult conversations with family and friends. </p>

                    <h1>How To Deal With These Rebuttals You Will Often Hear</h1>

                    <p><i>"Well, I think that ALL lives matter."</i> <br>A very common response to the phrase “Black Lives Matter” is the phrase “All Lives Matter”. Black Lives Matter is not trying to say that all lives DON’T matter, but rather that Black lives matter, TOO. Of course all lives matter. But, the phrase "all lives matter" cannot be true until Black lives matter too, making the phrase all lives matter an ignorant thing to say and something that usually serves to silence the voices of Black people and allies. 
                        
                    If you cannot understand why this phrase is ignorant to say, here is an analogy to help you:
                        If your house was on fire, you would ask people for help. But it wouldn’t make a lot of sense if someone responded to you with the phrase, “Well, we can’t just tend to your house – we also have to help all the other houses in the neighborhood because all houses matter”. The other houses clearly aren’t the ones in need of help at the moment. 
                    </p> 

                    <p><i>"White privilege isn't real."</i> <br>Having white privilege does not mean that every white person’s life is easy. This phrase is not said in attempts to discount the struggles of white people. All it means is that ONE of these struggles will not be discrimination due to the color of your skin. That is one element of privilege that white people will carry around no matter how few or many other struggles they are also facing.</p>
                    
                    <p><i>"I'm just tired of all these protests and demonstrations."</i><br>And the Black community & other POC are tired of racial inequality. Many people making this claim do not know what it’s like to have endured a lifetime of dealing with overt and covert racism & therefore do not get to choose how an oppressed group expresses their anger and frustration. </p>

                    <p><i>"Why can't I say the n-word? It's just a word."</i><br>The n-word has been used to degrade Black people for centuries, and it has recently been taken back by the Black community. They can use it as a way to reclaim it from the racist way it's been used in the past, but it still holds very heavy weight and racist intentions when used by non-Black people. In a similar manner, women can call their female friends "bitches" for fun as the word has been taken back by women, but it would be rude for a man to call a woman this. I believe it's best explained by Ta-Nehisi Coates in this short clip:
                        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CBvTl3FnDnb/?igshid=kd1ayctm7bco"><u>Here</u></a></p>
                    

                    <p><i>"Blue Lives Matter." </i><br>One cannot compare “Blue Lives” to Black Lives. No one is discounting that being a cop means potentially putting your life on the line for your job – but it is a blue SHIRT, not a blue life. A cop can take off their uniform and no longer be a cop for the moment. A Black person cannot take off their skin. They are ALWAYS living a Black life and cannot choose it. </p>
                    
                    <p><i>"Not all cops are bad... My relative is a cop and he's a great guy."</i><br>ACAB stands for “All cops are bastards”. People are often offended by this phrase, claiming to personally know a cop that is a very good person or has always done his/her job right. That may be very true: great people can be cops. But, all cops work for an outdated system that was formed from the roots of racial inequality in America. So, when people say ACAB they refer to the fact that cops work for a corrupt system and all people aiding the system are contributing to the systemic racism in our country today. This phrase does not mean your relative is a bad person just because he's a cop. </p>

                    <p><i>"I just can't support George Floyd because of his criminal past."</i><br>No matter if there were crimes committed or not, these people did  NOT deserve to die as victims of police brutality. Even people who are guilty are supposed to be granted the right to a fair trial. George Floyd was arrested for a supposed counterfeit $20 bill that cost him his life. Having a potential past of crime does not excuse the fact that an officer kneeled on his neck for 9 minutes. No matter how “good” or “bad” these victims were in their lives, they should NOT have died at the hands of police. <br>On top of that, there is a shockingly long list of people that were not even breaking the law when they were killed by police: Breonna Taylor, Elijah McClain, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin, Walter Scott, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile… and that’s just to name a few. </p>

                    <p><i>"We can't defund the police - who would you call when you're in danger?"</i><br>Defunding or abolishing the police brings an image of chaos and anarchy to the minds of many people upon initial thought. However, it's truly not that radical of an idea in practice. Defunding the police simply means that we won't be relying on one singular group of people who have less than 6 months of training to answer to every single problem that civilians may have. Instead the idea is that the "police" would consist of several different specialized units of people who are more specially trained to deal with a specific issue. This way, responders will be better equipped to deal with the issue at hand. Others also call for funds to be re-allocated into community-based programs as a way to prevent crime through education and social groups. Funding these groups could easily lead to less of a need for police and therefore less funds would be needed for police. Some American cities have had this in practice for years, such as Camden, NJ. Other cities have recently followed in its footsteps, such as Minneapolis, MN.</p>

                    <h1>Misleading Statistics That You Will Often Hear & How To Refute Them</h1>

                    <p><i>"More White people are killed by cops than Black people."</i><br>Yes - because there are more white people in America. White people made up 60.4% of the American population in 2019, while Black people made up 13.4%. So, obviously more white people are going to be killed - there are over 4x the amount of white people in America than Black people. However, if you look at the amount of people killed by population percentages, it is clear that Black people are killed by police at a drastically higher rate. There are 191M White people in America and 42M Black people. Therefore, there are 4.55X more White people than Black people. In 2019, there were 370 White people killed by the cops, so proportionally there should have been 82 Black people killed by the cops. But there were ACTUALLY 235 Black people killed by the police in 2019, a number 2.87 times higher than the expected number compared to White people. This proves that Black people are 3x more likely to be killed by the police - a HUGE disparity. </p>

                    <p><i>"Black people make up 13% of the population but commit 52% of violent crimes.”</i><br>Black people are incarcerated at a rate 7x higher than White people. If a White man and a Black man commit the same crime, the Black man will be 7x more likely to go to jail and will spend more time in jail than his White counterpart. Things that contribute to this higher rate of incarceration are that Black neighborhoods are overpoliced and the presence of De Facto segregation of neighborhoods due to gentrification and systemic poverty. There are clear reasons explaining why Black people are more likely to be incarcerated and why the numbers seem so disproportionate. The only other explanation, if one were to reject everything previously mentioned, is that Black people are inherently more violent – which is a blatantly a racist claim. One group of people is not born “inherently” more violent, so clearly our broken system has resulted in these skewed statistics.</p>

                    <p><i>"But what about Black on Black crime?"</i><br>FBI statistics show that 90.1% of Black homicide victims were killed by Black perpetrators. Similarly, 85.3% of white homicide victims were killed by white perpetrators but you never hear about “white on white crime”. </p>
